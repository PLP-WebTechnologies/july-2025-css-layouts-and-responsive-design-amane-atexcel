        <p>
            Responsive web design is about making websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices 
            for better usability. It relies on fluid layouts, which use flexible units instead of fixed 
            pixel values so that elements can scale naturally. Media queries allow designers to apply specific 
            styles depending on conditions such as screen width, ensuring that layouts change appropriately for mobile, tablet, and desktop. 
            Flexbox is useful for arranging elements in a single direction, making it ideal for navigation bars, centering content, and evenly 
            spacing items. CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, making it powerful for building page structures, galleries, or dashboards. 
            Together, Flexbox and Grid provide flexibility and control over how content is organized.Responsive design also includes adjusting typography and 
            images so they remain readable and visually balanced across devices. A mobile-first approach is often recommended, where the design is built for 
            smaller screens first and then enhanced for larger screens with additional rules.
